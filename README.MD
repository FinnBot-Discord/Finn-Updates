## Finn Updates
- This repository is designed to easily show the update history of Finn, my personal project Discord Bot from version 4.0.0 onwards.
- Currently this repository is scarce in terms of docs, This is because I like to push update notes before they go live, and I don't have much in terms of update docs at the moment.
- Thank you for taking the time to take a look through the repository!

## Version Numbering
- Version numbering is based on a major, minor, bugfix system. so V3.1.6 would be Major version 3, Minor revision 1, Bugfix patch 6.
[Current Version (V4.1.0)](https://github.com/FinnBot-Discord/Finn-Updates/blob/main/versions/V4.1.0.md)
