# Finn V4.1.0
Somewhat of a smaller update compared to V4.0.0, however still substantial.

## Auto Role
- Upon Joining the server, Finn will now automatically give you the "Member" Role.

## Reaction Roles
- In #roles in the server, you can now set your roles for all kinds of things. From Pronouns to what games you play.

## Music
- Fixed a bug where the music player would timeout too quickly, causing the bot to not play any queued links.
